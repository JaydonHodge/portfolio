# A webpage as my online portfolio :)

## Background
This project serves as both my online portfolio within tech aswell as being a framework of learning new technology for both frontend and backend web development. I gained a lot of hands-on experience with React and component-based architecture and JSX compilation, which definetely makes things more modular and cleaner. On the backend, I furthered my knowledge on PostgreSQL and database design and what it takes (through trial and tribulation haha) to wire up the database layer to backend APIs and frontend interfaces, all while using Docker containers. I retroactively came to learn this approach and level of sophistication is crucial for continuous integration & continuous delivery protocols.

## Architecure
RESTful API with CRUD operations, fully decoupled frontend/backend.

## Tech Stack:

- CSS
- Node.js
- Axios
- Vite
- Vercel
```
npm install
npm run dev
```

#### Backend:
- TypeScript
- PostgreSQL
- pg (PostgreSQL client library)
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Docker (for local development)
- Railway
```
docker-compose up --build
```
